Datatypes:
There are two main datatypes. One is premitive and the other is non-premitive.

Primitive data types are built in data types which are already defined in compilers and are used by programmers when creating variables in their program. There are 8 premitive datatypes.

For example :-
* int	(values ranges from (2^32)/2 to (2^32)/2-1 // it takes 4 bytes and default value is '0'.

* float	(values ranges from see see docs (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) to (+9,223,372,036,854,775,807). //takes 4 bytes, default value= 0.0f

* char	(values ranges from 0 to 65535(2^16-1) //it takes 2 bytes. The char datatype is single 16bit uincode character, minimum value "\u0000" or 0.

* bool  (values can be only TRUE or FALSE) // it's size depends on jvm java virtual machine, default value is FALSE.

* short	(value ranges from (2^16)/2 to (2^16)/2-1. // it takes 2 bytes and default value is '0'.

* long  (value ranges from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (2^63 â€“ 1). // it takes 8 bytes and default value is '0'.

* double (value ranges from (2^64)/2 to (2^64)/2-1. // it takes 8 bytes and default value is '0'.

* byte	 (value ranges -128 to 127) // it takes 1 byte and default value is '0'.		

Non-Primitive data types are the one which are derived from premitive datatypes.
For example :-
 * String
 * array
 * enum
 * class

Java is statically typed means variable must be declared before its use.




Rules to declare variables:
1: Must not begin with a digit (like int 1jawad;) is not allowed.
2: variable name is case sensitive (like Jawad and jawad both are different).
3: variable name should not be exact as keyword like (String jawad) is not allowed.
4: white spaces are not allowed in variables like (String user name) is not allowed.
5: can contain alphabets, $character, _character and digit if other conditions meet.
